# alcohol-dependence

This repository contains data and visualisation scripts for [*Genetic variants associated with alcohol dependence co-ordinate regulation of ADH genes in gastrointestinal and adipose tissues *] study.

In this study, we integrate data from multiple sources (i.e. NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog, GTEx, HaploReg) to analyze 73 AD associated SNPs and identify 34 expression quantitative loci (eQTL) with potential regulatory roles that impact AD. We report that 42% of the 285 significant tissue-specific regulatory interactions we identify were associated with four genes encoding Alcohol Dehydrogenase - ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH4. Identified eQTLs produced a coordinated regulatory action between ADH genes, especially between ADH1A and ADH1C within the subcutaneous adipose and gastrointestinal tissues.
